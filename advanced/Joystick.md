# Joystick

This page contains the guide that you can use for setting your microbit like joystick for [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/).
It is the basis for the implementation of advanced Scratch games.

It is part of the [educational repository](http://www.coderdojofosso.it/download/) to learn how to write code by blocks.
Educational repository is an italian page because the material is used by an italian team of [CoderDojo](https://coderdojo.com/).

If you have any problem, create an issue.

## Materials

- microbit
- microbit's usb cable or that of your android
- your computer
- internet for downloading some programs

## Installation
### Download [Scratchbit](https://github.com/vecsei/Scratchbit)
The original microbit program is implemented by [vecsei](https://github.com/vecsei).
In his repo you find a .py file that you have to flash into your microbit.
A method to flash it into your microbit is by [uflash](https://github.com/ntoll/uflash).
Another method is the [alternative](https://github.com/bbcmicrobit/micropython) presented on the front page.
### Download [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/download)
The method is also tested by Scratch online, but we want our kids to work offline safely.
In the [vecsei repo](https://github.com/vecsei/Scratchbit) there is also a .sb2 file that it is a sample of Scratch program.
You can open it into your Scratch standalone version.
